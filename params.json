This will return a new object with the following methods:\r\n\r\n* `canvas()`: Returns canvas element.\r\n* `resize()`: If your viewer changes size, you'll need to resize the canvas overlay by calling this method.\r\n* `clear()`: Clears canvas.\r\n* `context2d()`: Gives access to 2d context of canvas, to draw on it.\r\n* `redrawCanvas()`: You can use this function to draw on canvas. \r\n* `onAnimation()`: This function is called on animation, i.e. zoom and pan of overlay. You can use it to clear canvas before redraw, for example. \r\n\r\nSee [online demo](http://altert.github.io/OpenSeadragonCanvasOverlay/demo.html) or demo.html for an example of it in use. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
